Installation:
==============
1 Data
------
To obtain really accurate postage quotes directly from Australia Post the following fields are preferred. The module will still return quotations if dimensions are not provided.

To use this Zen Cart plugin for calculating postage with Australia Post IT IS PREFERRED that you 
have made the following customisation to Zen Cart.

    The products table SHOULD include the following fields:
    - products_width (included by default in Zen Cart)
    - products_length (included by default in Zen Cart 2.0)
    - products_height. (included by default in Zen Cart 2.0)
    
    The latter three fields can be added by installing the "Numinix Product Fields" add on and adding the predefined custom group "products_dimensions". These fields must have valid values to calculate the postage charges correctly. 
    Dimensions should be in cm, weight should be in grams (gms).
    If you have used the OzPpost postage calculator previously you will have these 
    fields. If you do not add the extra fields and populate their values the module will use default values.
    The default values are 10cm x 10cm x 2cm which will be a small parcel.

4 Additional Configurations
=========================
4.1 Select the postage options you wish to offer to customers.
4.2 Add handling fees if you factor in costs for material and packaging.
4.3 Cost on error is the default if a valid postage rate is not returned or the Australia Post servers cannot be reached. I recommend an amount large enough to cover most postage and that will be obvious eg 99.99.
4.4 The Tare percent allows for weight of packaging etc when requesting postage rates. The default is 10.

-------------------------------------------------
Upgrading from Australia Post Shipping Module previous versions
-------------------------------------------------
A complete removal and reinstall is recommended.
1. Note Australia Post API key and other settings.
2. Remove old module.
3. Overwrite the files with the new fileset.
4. Install new version.
5. Re-enter Australia Post API key and other settings.

If you have used the defunct OzPost Shipping Module ensure that all OzPost files are removed.

Tax (GST) Calculations
======================
Australia Post postage rates to Australian destinations includes GST. This is taken into account in the module by providing the GST exempt price to Zen Cart and letting Zen Cart process the tax according to the rules you have defined. The tax-basis returned by aupost is "Shipping" 
    so ensure that the setting 
        Admin | Configuration | My Store | Basis of Shipping Tax is set to "Shipping" 
    and that the Tax Class set in 
        Admin | Modules |shipping |aupost is set to your tax rate that covers GST.
Australia Post postage rates to overseas destinations do not include GST. Set your Tax Class in 
    Admin | Modules |shipping |aupostoverseas     to your tax rate that does not include GST.

Parcel sizing calculations
==========================
NOTE: The sizing calculations are primitive eg dimensions are totalled so many small items are made into one long parcel.
