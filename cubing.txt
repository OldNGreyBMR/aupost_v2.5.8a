A word about cubing:
--------------------

 Getting this module to support the cubing rules has not been an easy task. I'm not a mathematician, nor am I 
 an expert in 3d modelling, and there were some tough choices that needed to be made when multiple 
 items of different dimensions are purchased at the same time.  Simply adding the cubes of each item wouldn't
 give a 'real world' parcel size. 
                            length  width  height cube 	 
    example:    parcel 'A'  100cm x 50cm x 20cm = 100,000ccm
                parcel 'B'  10cm x  10cm x 10cm =   1,000ccm 
 
    If we sum the cubes, we get 101,000ccm 
    However, how big will our parcel be ?  We cant use the cube root (46.57) because it is kinda obvious
    that we probably shouldn't be chopping item 'A' in half or scrunching it up to make it fit inside of 'cube'. 
    
    What I opted to do was to 'stack' the objects on top of the largest item purchased. Using the same
    parcels above, this means our parcel will need to be 
    100cm x 50cm * (20cm + 10cm)  = 150,000ccm  - ie, there's going to be a lot of 'air' in the box. 
    
    This problem is compounded if a person buys 2 of item 'B', because although both you and I know 
    that we can stack the two small items side by side on top of the larger item I really don't have
    the foggiest idea of how to tell the software that we can do that, so what it does is stack all three 
    items, giving a parcel size of 
    100cm x 50cm * (20cm + (10cm x 2))  = 200,000ccm  - ie, there's going to be a lot more 'air' in the box. 
    This means that some of your quotes will probably end up higher than reality, because in this case we
    can easily fit both items into a box measuring 100x50x20 
    
    If THAT isn't enough to worry about, the fact that we are stacking items means that we run a real
    risk of exceeding the maximum 'length' of any given parcel.  If we assume someone buys 20 of item "B", 
    when we stack 'em we get a parcel measuring 200x10x10  -  The 'height' becomes the 'length' and this parcel will 
    be too long to mail.  Of course, in the 'real world' we wouldn't pack these items in this manner - we'd 
    stack them in rows and columns instead of the single dimension - These 20 items would fit into a box 
    measuring 100x20x10 and even 50x20x20, depending how they are stacked, both boxes are well within the limits
    imposed by AustPost.  
    
    The best way to mitigate this problem is to 'prepack' any items where you are likely to consistantly be 
    selling more than one at a time. With the example above, a 'bulk pack' of 20 items can be given real-world
    dimensions, and your customers will only need order 1 pack of 20 rather than 20 packs of one.

I have not been able to improve on this approach. 
The downside is where multiple small items less than 1cm high can fit side by side and be sent via letter rate whereas when stacked they exceed the 2cm max letter size so have to be sent as a parcel. In Australia letters are not tracked while parcels are.
